        Hello, world!
        This is a new line to check how things get updated through git (bash)
        So then I add something on github, how does that get downloaded onto the local file?
        This is in the online 3 hello commit
        This is the second online test of causing 3 hello merge conflicts
        This is the local third three hello commit
